/*
This is a React app that uses Redux store with a reducer and a middleware.

Your assignment is to make it more readable, and also add some functionality.

Specifically, please consider doing the following, in no particular order:
 1) Replace single-letter variable names with something more descriptive.
 2) Provide comments for each of the functions.
 3) Provide a general comment for the entire program, describing its purpose.
 4) Replace type any with something more specific.
 5) Do not allow timer to increment counter past 10.
 6) Trigger an alert when counter reaches 20.
 7) If counter goes below zero, make timer decrement rather than increment it.
 8) Add a drop-down to select increment and decrement step between 1, 2, and 3.
 9) Use monospace font for all text on the page.
 10) Create unit tests for increment, decrement and counter functions.
 11) Create package configuration that could be used to serve the page.
 12) Change App to log the timestamp of when that component did mount.
